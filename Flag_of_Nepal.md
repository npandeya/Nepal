# Flag of Nepal

## Introduction

The flag of Nepal is unique as it is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular or square. It has a distinctive shape composed of two stacked triangles, often described as a double-pennon.

## Design and Symbolism

- The flag consists of two overlapping triangular shapes.
- The crimson red color of the flag represents bravery and courage, which is Nepal's national color.
- The blue border around the flag symbolizes peace and harmony.
- The two triangles symbolize the Himalayan Mountains and represent the two major religions of Nepal, Hinduism and Buddhism.
- Within the triangles, there are emblematic celestial bodies:
  - The upper triangle bears a white moon.
  - The lower triangle bears a white sun.
  - Historically, the moon and sun had facial features, but the current design omits them.
  - The moon symbolizes the cool weather of the Himalayas and the calm nature of the Nepalese people.
  - The sun represents the fierce resolve of the Nepalese and the heat of the southern lowlands.
- The flag's shape and symbols collectively signify Nepal's independence, the country's religious heritage, and the natural beauty of its landscape.

## History

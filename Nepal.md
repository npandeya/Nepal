# Nepal

Nepal is a South Asian country located mainly in the Himalayas, bordered by China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. It is renowned for its diverse landscape that includes fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. The country has a rich cultural heritage with deep-rooted traditions influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism. Kathmandu is the capital and largest city, serving as the cultural and economic hub.

Nepal’s economy is primarily based on agriculture, tourism, and remittances from abroad. The nation attracts many visitors for trekking, mountaineering, and exploring its ancient temples and heritage sites. Despite its natural beauty and cultural wealth, Nepal faces challenges such as poverty, political instability, and infrastructure development.
